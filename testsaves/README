To use the testsuite, run /bin/aitest. See aitest usage for details.

CONTENTS

/original1.10/         Original 1.10 replay files.
/human1.11/            Replays converted to 1.11 and saved at critical point.
/conf/                 Conf file which holds "1" if P1 is primary player (next turn), "2" otherwise.
/ai-cfg/               ai tags ready to be injected into WML save files.

Every scen_code should be a string, e.g. G1, corresponding to 

- .gz replay in /human1.11/     (mandatory)
- .aiplayer text in /conf/      (optional)
- .gz replay in /original1.10/  (optional)

scen_code.aiplayer should contain "1" or "2" depending on who moves next in replay (primary player).

Every ai_type corresponds to a WML block in /ai-cfg/.



HOW TO ADD REPLAYS TO THE SUITE:
1) Take any replay, load it in 1.11 replay viewer (check the show replay button).
Advance to the turn of interest and save the replay, in /human1.11/, as a compressed .gz file.
2) Make a matching .aiplayer text file, indicating which player moves first in this replay. 
E.g. echo "1" > /conf/G4.aiplayer
     echo "2" > /conf/mygame.aiplayer
3) Save the original as well in case you want to compare ai actions to human actions later.

WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE SUITE DO
The scripts in the suite will unzip the replay and use sed to replace the [ai] tag of a particular side
with the contents of some file. They will also set the controller key to value "ai". The result is zipped
and saved in ~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.11/saves.

The scripts will also delete .lp files from /testsaves/bin, as the debugging mode of MCLP may generate these.
